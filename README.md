# 🐍 Problem Solving in Python  

Welcome to my **Problem Solving Repository**! 🚀  
Here, I’ve collected my solutions to coding challenges from different platforms — written in **Python** 🐍.  
The goal of this repo is to **sharpen problem-solving skills, learn algorithms, and write clean code**.  


## 📌 About This Repo

🏫 Started as a way to practice programming during my early college years.

🐍 All solutions are implemented in Python.

✅ Beginner-friendly problems (freshman year)
✅ Data Structures & Algorithms (sophomore year)
✅ Minimization & Optimization problems

🎯 Problems are from different online platforms, coding assignments, and practice sheets.

## 💡 Why This Repo?

This repo isn’t about advanced algorithms — it’s about building a strong foundation in Python through hands-on practice.
If you’re just starting your Python journey, you’ll find these problems beginner-friendly and a great way to get comfortable with coding.
